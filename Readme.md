# NFT Bundle Contract

## Project Title
NFT Bundle Trading System

## Project Description
The NFT Bundle Contract is a smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that enables users to create, manage, and trade collections of NFTs as unified bundles. This system allows NFT collectors and traders to package multiple NFTs together and sell them as a single unit, providing a more efficient way to trade collections of related digital assets.

The contract facilitates the creation of NFT bundles where users can combine multiple NFT token IDs into a single tradeable package with a set price. Buyers can then purchase entire bundles in one transaction, streamlining the process of acquiring multiple NFTs simultaneously.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize the NFT marketplace by introducing bundle trading capabilities that:
- Simplify the process of trading multiple NFTs
- Enable collectors to curate and sell themed collections
- Reduce transaction costs by bundling multiple assets
- Create new opportunities for NFT portfolio management
- Foster a more dynamic and flexible NFT ecosystem

We aim to become the leading platform for NFT bundle trading, making it easier for creators, collectors, and traders to manage and exchange digital asset collections efficiently.
